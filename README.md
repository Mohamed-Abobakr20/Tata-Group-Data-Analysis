## Task 1
> Summary

- An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.
- For this task, you are only required to draft the questions (4 for CMO and 4 for CEO). Make sure to think both quantitatively and qualitatively.
- Youâ€™ve been provided a dataset in the resources below to use as the basis for your exploration. Review this data, taking note of what information has been provided, what insights you can garner, and what is relevant to both the CEO and CMO respectively.

## Task 2
> Summary

- In this task, you will be required to read the questions carefully and understand that business requirement. Once you have an idea of what is required from the perspective of the CEO and CMO, you will need to come up with the perfect visual which will illustrate what the senior managers are looking for in each scenario. Remember, data can be presented in multiple types of charts, but you are required to select the visual that would best display the information which is being presented.


## Task 3
> Summary

- In this task, you will create the visuals around four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested. You can use either Tableau or Power BI to create the visuals.

> Data Cleaning Steps

You have noticed that the data contains some returns to the store which are provided in negative quantities and there are unit prices which were input in error. You will need to perform the following steps to clean this data.
- Removing duplicate rows
- Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit
- Create a check that the Unit price should not be below or equal $0
